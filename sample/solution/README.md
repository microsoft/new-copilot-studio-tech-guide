# BlastBox Omega — Demo Solution

This folder holds the **portable Copilot Studio solution** behind the BlastBox Omega
demo: the two solution zips, their unpacked source, the connector code, and the skill
bundles.

## To deploy, use `deploy/`

Don't stand this up by hand. The repo ships a single cross-platform script that does the
whole thing: imports both solutions, deploys every MCP connector's inline code, publishes
customizations, creates the no-auth connections, and publishes the agents, then prints the
one manual UI step that has no API (re-attaching the connection-bound tools).

```bash
pac auth create                   # once: sign pac in to the target tenant
node deploy/deploy.mjs            # guided: pick profile, pick env, deploy
node deploy/deploy.mjs --help     # all options
```

See [`deploy/README.md`](../../deploy/README.md) for the full walkthrough, requirements, and the manual
re-attach table.

## What's in this folder

| File / folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `BlastBoxConnectors_1_0_0_1.zip` | The **connectors** solution (5 inline MCP servers). Imports as unique name `BlastBoxConnectors`. |
| `BlastBoxAgents_1_0_0_1.zip` | The **agents** solution (5 agents + Python skills). Imports as unique name `BlastBoxDeploy`. |
| `connectors/<slug>/` | Each MCP connector's `apiDefinition.json`, `apiProperties.json`, and inline `script.csx` (what the script deploys via `pac connector update`). |
| `skills/` | The Python skill bundles that ride in on the agents solution (reference copies). |
| `src/` | The **unpacked** source of both solutions (`pac solution unpack`), for inspection/diffing. Not imported directly. |

## Solution package layout

The unpacked solution and importable ZIP intentionally use different layouts:

- Unpacked source keeps `Solution.xml` and `Customizations.xml` under
  `src/<solution>/Other/`.
- An importable ZIP must have `solution.xml`, `customizations.xml`, and
  `[Content_Types].xml` at its root. It must not contain an `Other/` folder.

Never create a solution ZIP with a general-purpose archive command. Rebuild it
with the Power Platform solution packer:

```powershell
pac solution pack `
  --zipfile sample\solution\BlastBoxAgents_1_0_0_1.zip `
  --folder sample\solution\src\BlastBoxAgents `
  --packagetype Unmanaged `
  --clobber
```

The Curb Pickup Assistant configuration must contain exactly one instruction
segment. Multiple imported segments can exist in Dataverse but fail to render in
the Copilot Studio instruction editor.

Validate both committed packages before import:

```powershell
python deploy\validate_solution_packages.py
```

### Connectors (5 inline MCP servers — custom code, no external hosting)

| Connector | Slug | Schema name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Curb Pickup MCP | `curb-delivery-mcp` | `cat_curb-20pickup-20mcp` |
| Membership MCP v2 | `membership-mcp-v2` | `cat_membership-20mcp-20v2` |
| Order Management MCP | `order-management-mcp` | `new_order-20management-20mcp` |
| Policy RAG MCP v2 | `policy-rag-mcp-v2` | `new_policy-20rag-20mcp-20v2` |
| Warehouse MCP | `warehouse-mcp` | `new_warehouse-20mcp` |

### Agents (5)

| Agent | Role | Tools / connected agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Store Associate Assistant** | Parent — **flagship** (Block Party Trade-Up) | Order Management MCP + Membership MCP v2; connected: Store Policy, Inventory & Fulfillment; skills: prorated-refund-calculator, points-reconciliation, slip-pdf-generator |
| **Returns & Service Assistant** | Parent — **self-serve** (Card Reissue) | Membership MCP v2; connected: Store Policy; skills: card-reissue, membership-card-png |
| **Curb Pickup Assistant** | Parent — **customer pickup** (Weather-aware Curb Pickup) | Curb Pickup MCP + MSN Weather; connected: Store Associate; skills: curbside-bay-selector, curbside-slip-pdf |
| **Store Policy Agent** | Connected child | Policy RAG MCP v2 |
| **Inventory & Fulfillment Agent** | Connected child | Warehouse MCP |

## Prerequisites

- A Power Platform environment with **Dataverse** and **Copilot Studio** enabled, and the
  **new Copilot Studio experience** turned on. A **First Release / Early Release**
  environment is strongly preferred.
- Permission to import solutions and create connections in that environment.

## Validate — the three scenarios

After deploying (and doing the one re-attach step the script prints), open each parent
agent in **Preview** and run the scripted transcripts. Use the activity map to confirm
that every expected MCP tool, connector action, connected agent, and Python skill fires.

**Self-Serve Card Reissue** (Returns & Service Assistant) — member `MEGA-BLAST-1024`.
Expect: `get_membership` → identity check → `reissue_card` → `membership-card-png` →
`blastpass_card.png`. Prompts:
`sample/archive/store-solution/evals/self-serve-card-reissue.md`.

**Block Party Trade-Up** (Store Associate Assistant) — member `MEGA-BLAST-1024`. Expect
`$76.66` / `$100.00` / `$23.34`, the three MEGA exclusives, and a generated PDF slip.
Prompts: `sample/archive/store-solution/evals/flagship-block-party-trade-up-runbook.md`.

**Weather-aware Curb Pickup** (Curb Pickup Assistant) — order `ORD-10502`, member
`MEGA-BLAST-1024`, and an optional customer ETA. Expect a verified order location and
exact membership `tier_code`, informational store hours, live-weather classification,
one fresh bay queue snapshot, and `blastbox_curbside_slip.pdf` as the only successful
response. Each bay starts with 6–10 demo orders ahead. For follow-up progression,
each order clears every 30 seconds; the assistant remembers the prior update time
and returns a recalculated curb-ready estimate. Exact weather, queue, wait, and bay
vary by run. Prompts:
`https://microsoft.github.io/new-copilot-studio-tech-guide/scenarios/curb-pickup-assistant`.

## Notes

- All data is mock; serials, prices, and confirmation numbers are illustrative.
- The Python skills ride in on the agents solution and register on publish; no manual
  skill upload is needed.
- `src/` is the `pac solution unpack` output of the two zips — use it to diff or inspect
  the connector code and agent definitions; you do **not** import `src/` directly.
